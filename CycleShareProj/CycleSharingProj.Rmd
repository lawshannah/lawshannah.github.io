## **Introduction**
This report and analysis on Seattle's bicycle sharing trends. The data includes weather reports for the area, the station locations, and trips taken by cycle riders. Future explorations could include the addition of other forms of public transportation for the Seatle area to better understand commuter travel trends. We also hope to use this report to make a good grade in the fabulous Dr. Arnholt's Stats 3530 Data Science class.

## **Station Locations**
Lets take a look at where the rental stations are located in Seattle!
```{r}
#For show (the graphs , THE EVI-DANCE) Formating the dates
station$install_date <- mdy(station$install_date)


# How many times were new stations installed?
station %>% summarise(n_distinct(install_date))
# How many stations were installed on each date
station %>% group_by(install_date) %>% summarise(count = n()) %>% 
    arrange(install_date)



station %>% summarise(n_distinct(station_id))

station_locs <- station %>% group_by(station_id) %>% select(1:4, 
    -2)


mymap <- get_map(location = "Seattle", maptype = "roadmap", zoom = 13)

# Plot a single point for each Station ID
ggmap(mymap) + geom_point(aes(x = long, y = lat), data = station_locs, 
    alpha = 1, color = "darkred", size = 3)
```


Look at all those stations! Its hard to believe they managed to go out of business!


## Histogram of Number of Bikes per Station

```{r, label = "nbs", fig.cap = "Current dock count", echo = FALSE}
#histogram showing current dock count
ggplot(data = station, aes (x = current_dockcount)) +
geom_bar(fill = "pink", color = "black") +
theme_classic() +
labs( x = "Number of bikes per station", y= "count", title = "Current Dock Count")
```
# hist(station$current_dockcount, breaks = 10, main = "Current Dock Count", xlab = "Number of Bikes Per Station")
# ggplot(station, aes(x = current_dockcount)) + geom_histogram()





```{r}
dock_change <- station %>% group_by(station_id) %>% select(station_id, 
    long, lat, ends_with("dockcount")) %>% mutate(dock_change = current_dockcount - 
    install_dockcount)


#attempt to recreate map plot thing

closeUp <- get_map(location = "Seattle", maptype = "roadmap", zoom = 13)

ggmap(closeUp) + geom_point(aes(x = long, y = lat, size = factor(dock_change), 
                                color = factor(dock_change)), 
                            data = dock_change, alpha = 0.8) + 
  guides(color = guide_legend(title = "change"), size = guide_legend(title = "change")) + 
           scale_size_manual(values = 10:1)




# Change in docking station 
dock_change <- station %>% group_by(station_id) %>% select(station_id, 
long, lat, ends_with("dockcount")) %>% mutate(dock_change = current_dockcount -     install_dockcount)


```

11 stations lost bike docks, 39 docks stayed the same, 8 stations gained docks.
